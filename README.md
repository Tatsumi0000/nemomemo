# ðŸ«° nemomemo [WIP]
Nemomemo is memo application on desktop using KMP.

The name Nemomemo was inspired by the song title [ë„¤ëª¨ë„¤ëª¨(nemonemo)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPp8hbuZwW0) by [YENA](https://yhfamily.co.kr/?module=Default&action=DefaultAt&sAt=007).


## ðŸ’» Development
* `/composeApp` is for code that will be shared across your Compose Multiplatform applications.
  It contains several subfolders:
  - `commonMain` is for code thatâ€™s common for all targets.
  - Other folders are for Kotlin code that will be compiled for only the platform indicated in the folder name.
    For example, if you want to use Appleâ€™s CoreCrypto for the iOS part of your Kotlin app,
    `iosMain` would be the right folder for such calls.
